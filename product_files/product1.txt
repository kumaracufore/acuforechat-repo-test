PTO is Power Take Off
REMOTE POWER 
When you live on a rural property, you need to be versatile. And you expect the same from your 
equipment. Baumalight PTO generators are portable and easy for one person to hook up to their 
tractor. The trailer design gives you more flexibility, allowing you to move the power to where it is 
needed most. 
DisplayMaster1 
DisplayMaster1 is more than a volt meter, it gives you a glance monitoring of your generator’s 
performance including voltage, frequency, amperage, KW, KVA, runtime and more. Included on 
all KR and QC Generators 
CONTROL AT A GLANCE 
Designed exclusively for BAUMALIGHT KR and QC generators, the DisplayMaster1 is your guide for 
quick, easy setup and an “at a glance” monitor of key performance factors. Getting the power up and 
running is a simple task with the intuitive 3 light system. The bright LEDs give instant feedback 
whether over or under speed. Once optimal PTO speed is reached the green light is lit and you are 
ready to go. The solid state microprocessor then monitors the performance of the generator. This 
rugged design allows for accurate performance even in subzero conditions. The back lit display is 
quickly and easily read even in low-light situations. The display scrolls through the monitored 
features at 30 second intervals so you are always on top of the generator’s performance. Like the rest 
of the generator the DisplayMaster1 is designed for long life and easy servicing with easy board 
exchange plug-in connectors. 
Voltage, Frequency & Amperage 
This screen shows the actual Voltage, Frequency and Amperage being drawn on each line. This allows 
you to monitor and adjust to balance the load on each line for more stability and prolonged life of 
your generator. 
Voltage : is displayed for each line and in single phase the third value is the average across both lines. 
Hertz : (Frequency) is shown in a value of 1 tenth of a Hertz. Amperage : is displayed for each line. 
KW, KVA, POWER FACTOR 
KW : * Kw is shown; this is the actual load being used. 
KVA : * Kva is also shown, this is power required by the loads being supplied by the generator and 
should not exceed the rated power of the machine. 
Power Factor : * Power factor (out-of-phase lag) is calculated and displayed. A totally resistive load 
(heat) will have a power factor of one while a totally inductive load (motors) could be as low as .8 a 
higher power factor means better efficiency. A low power factor can misrepresent the power 
required from the generator, meaning the generator is working harder than is being shown. With this 
information you can monitor how hard the generator is working and prevent damage from 
overloading. 
RUNTIME & KW HOURS 
This display shows the time run and amount of power generated by the unit from new. 
Runtime : * is recorded and displayed; this is total hours the unit has run from new. 
KW Hours : * are calculated and displayed; this is total current in Kw produced. One Kw for one hour 
is one Kw hour and ten Kw for one hour is ten Kw hours while one Kw for 10 hours is also ten Kw 
hours. Kw hours produced are recorded to memory and multiplied from day one. 
PEAK / AVERAGE KVA 
Peak/Average KVA : * is monitored and displayed. This is a calculation based on the span between 
machine start-up and machine shutdown. This allows you to monitor what your systems requires of 
your generator. You can see what you need to run (average) and your peak needs (motors starting 
etc.) which helps you evaluate your system and predict future needs and upgrades. 
* Not available in 3 phase delta connection. 
TX Series PTO Generators 
With the Baumalight TX series of PTO generators, power is as close by as your tractor. With one less 
engine to maintain on your property, the TX series of portable generators gives you the advantage of 
using your reliable tractor during an emergency situation or simply for additional power when 
required. Designed to back up small farms and estates like yours, the TX PTO generators feature 
simple connections and controls that provide quick and easy access to power when you need it. The 
TX series of PTO generators are suited to tractors from 10 hp to 50 hp and provide backup or remote 
power from 7 Kilowatts to 31 Kilowatts. 
In-field breakdowns can happen anywhere and at the worst time. Paired with a portable welder, TX 
PTO generators allow you to take power to where you need it the most, making them a perfect repair 
partner. 
Price includes PTO Shaft, Trailer and 10 ft cord with Anderson connector. 
KR Series PTO Generators 
Our newest addition to our line of PTO generators, the KR series generators are designed to fit 
tractors from 45 to 97 horsepower and support power requirements from 30 kilowatts to 65 
kilowatts. The KR model's generator assembly is made in Canada and the main components are 
made in Europe. When the unexpected happens, you can rely on the trusted combination of your 
tractor and your KR generator to get you back up and running. With one less engine to maintain, a 
PTO generator is an effective, reliable backup power source for your smaller appliances and large 
equipment motors on your farm. The KR series is a 4-pole copper winding generator that features a 
brushless design for less maintenance, automatic voltage regulation and DisplayMaster1, 
Baumalight's own at a glance performance monitor. Price includes PTO Shaft, Trailer and 10 ft cord 
with Anderson connector.
